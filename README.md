#Rice BioE 521 Final Project

##PROJECT TITLE:

RazzyFAB (Fencing Arduino Box)

##BRAINSTORM / ROUGH ABSTRACT: 

Fencing scoring machines cost, on average, $1,400.   We will make a cost-effective electric scoring machine utilizing an Arduino.
The Arduino will perform all the functions that current machines typically perform using hard-wired setups.  Our machine will 
be cheaper and simpler than current machines.

Current scoring machines are capable of electrically scoring each of three weapons in fencing: épeé, foil, and saber.  Our device 
will programmatically be able to switch between different modes depending on the weapon type.  The machine will accept standard 
hard-wired inputs from fencing body-cords.  The RazzyFAB will output valid touches during a fencing bout in the form of 4 LEDs and 
1 speaker.  A single colored LED will light up when the corresponding fencer strikes valid target along with a buzzer sound.  Two 
colored LEDs will light if both fencers strike valid target within permitted times.  White LEDs will illuminate if a fencer strikes
off-target.
